`AlienInvaders` (java) is a very simple space invaders like game using a surfaceview.

`AlienInvaders_kt` (kotlin) is a very simple space invaders like game using a surfaceview.  Note, some non android classes are still java.

`AnimatedGifDemo` (java) shows how to use the animated Drawable class to have animated gifs.  NOTE: api 28+

`DrawDemo1` (java) uses a canvas from a imageview to draw on.  There are 4 fragments.  main draws different types of objects, based on a spinner and some need two taps to be drawn like a line.  there is a animated fragments to clear an uses a thread, asyc uses a aysctask. draw1 only draws one object on the screen.

`TextureViewDemo` (java) is an example of how to draw on a surface (via a canvas) of a TextureView.  It uses a thread to update the moving block.  It shows to use an extended textureView and how use all the code in the main.  (same example as the surfaceViewDemo)

`TextureViewDemo_kt` (kotlin) is an example of how to draw on a surface (via a canvas) of a TextureView.  It uses a thread to update the moving block.  It shows to use an extended textureView and how use all the code in the main.  (same example as the surfaceViewDemo)
